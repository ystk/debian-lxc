lxc (1:1.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  LXC before 1.1 did silently ignore lxc.aa_profile if the kernel did
  not have the AppArmor mount feature (by checking for the existence of
  /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/features/mount/mask).

  As of LXC 1.1 it will error out with the following message in the log:
  Incomplete AppArmor support in your kernel
  If you really want to start this container, set
  lxc.aa_allow_incomplete = 1 in your container configuration file

  Debian does not ship with AppArmor enabled in the kernel by default,
  so this should not affect default installs. However if you have enabled
  AppArmor, your containers will fail to start after the upgrade.

  Please add "lxc.aa_allow_incomplete = 1" to your configuration to
  start AppArmor-secured containers until we have full support in the
  kernel.
